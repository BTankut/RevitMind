# RevitMind

RevitMind is an intelligent assistant for Autodesk Revit that leverages the power of AI to help MEP engineers and designers work more efficiently. Built as a pyRevit extension, it provides natural language interaction with Revit, allowing users to perform complex tasks using simple commands.

## Features

- ü§ñ Natural Language Processing: Interact with Revit using plain English or Turkish commands
- üîç Smart MEP Analysis: Analyze ductwork, piping, and other MEP elements
- üìä Automated Measurements: Calculate lengths, sizes, and other parameters automatically
- üõ†Ô∏è Custom Commands: Perform complex operations with simple text commands
- üåê AI-Powered: Utilizes OpenRouter API for intelligent command processing
