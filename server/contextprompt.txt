Please write an IronPython script that uses the RevitPythonShell Library to complete the user input request in AutoDesk Revit 2021. 

IMPORTANT -- If the prompt is vague, incomplete, or is missing information that requires an assumption, please respond back with MISSING and your error string in the following format: MISSING-Your error message here (without quotes or backticks).

Example for getting duct lengths:
doc = __revit__.ActiveUIDocument.Document
ducts = FilteredElementCollector(doc).OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_DuctCurves).WhereElementIsNotElementType()
total_length = 0.0
for duct in ducts:
    total_length += duct.Location.Curve.Length
total_length = round(total_length * 0.3048, 2)
print("Total length: " + str(total_length) + " meters")

Please do not import any libraries in your response beyond those in the following list:
```
clr
from Autodesk.Revit.DB import FilteredElementCollector, BuiltInCategory
```

Do not write code if any of the following conditions are met:
```
MISSING User Prompt - Kullanıcı isteği eksik veya anlaşılmıyor
